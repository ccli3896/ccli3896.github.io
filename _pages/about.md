My name is Chenguang Li (I go by Chenchen). I study computational neuroscience and am doing a PhD at Harvard, coadvised by Gabriel Kreiman and Sharad Ramanathan. Right now I'm interested in neural augmentation and what it means to build a brain, both in terms of evolution and how it might happen artificially. 

I also like to run around the Charles River and take pictures of geese. Follow me and the local wildlife in Cambridge, MA on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/69613837).
