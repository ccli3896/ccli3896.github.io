Here's a poster for a workshop at the 2021 NeurIPS conference. The project was with Arturo Deza, a postdoc in Tommy Poggio's lab at MIT, and came out of the 2021 Center for Brains, Minds and Machines summer course at Woods Hole. The workshop was on Shared Visual Representations in Human and Machine Intelligence (SVRHM).
