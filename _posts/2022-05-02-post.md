In March I went to Lisbon to give a talk at the 2022 Cosyne (<ins>Co</ins>mputational and <ins>Sy</ins>stems <ins>Ne</ins>uroscience) conference.

It's about 10 minutes long and is a fairly quick summary of our ideas, with some neat results we've gotten so far. It's about integrating deep reinforcement learning agents with a living nematode's nervous system. The goal is to wrap up this project in the next month; hopefully by then we'll have a preprint out.
