In March I went to Lisbon to give a talk at the 2022 Cosyne (<ins>Co</ins>mputational and <ins>Sy</ins>stems <ins>Ne</ins>uroscience) conference. It's about 10 minutes long, so is a fairly quick summary of our ideas and some neat results we've gotten so far. I'm hoping to wrap up this project in the next month. Hopefully by then we'll have a preprint out.
